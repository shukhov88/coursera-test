                <p>In terms of wrapped meals, the Shredded Chicken Burrito is 
                   almost perfect. Almost. However, the one thing that might 
                   make this guy a little better is a different tense. Every 
                   time we take a bite of it, we can’t help but think about what
                   this burrito would be like if it was shreddING instead of 
                   shredded. Can you imagine? Every time you took a bite, 
                   the chicken just ripped a guitar solo all the way down into 
                   your stomach? Or like, it caught a massive wave of 
                   Mountain Dew® Baja Blast™ down your throat, and surfed 
                   a gnarly beverage barrel all the way to your tummy?</p>

                 <p>Whether your preference is a butter-soft fillet steak, 
                    tasty sirloin or thrifty cut like bavette or skirt, care 
                    and attention should be paid when cooking your beef. With 
                    only a few minutes leeway between rare and well-done, timing 
                    is key. We've put together some tips to help you from start
                    to finish. We recommend frying your steak, although you can 
                    grill it if you prefer. A heavy-duty, thick-based frying pan, 
                    ideally with a non-stick coating, will achieve good results, 
                    as will a heavy griddle pan or skillet. These types of pans 
                    get really hot – ideal for getting that slightly sweet, 
                    charred finish to the outside of your meat.</p>

                  <p>Technically, the word sashimi means "pierced body", where 
                     sashi = (pierced,stuck) and mi = (body, meat). Integrated 
                     into the english language it is often used to refer 
                     to uncooked fish preparations. Generally, Sashimi can be 
                     identified or defined as a piece of meat, not necessarily 
                     only seafood and not necessarily raw, typically draped over 
                     a garnish like daikon (asian white radish shredded into 
                     long strands) and possibly accompanied by one perilla leaf 
                     per slice. Sashimi is often normally served with a dipping 
                     sauce like soy sauce with wasabi paste or ponzu sauce 
                     a citrus based sauce made by mixing soy sauce, lemon juice, 
                     rice vinegar, dashi, and mirin).</p>
